# Out-of-dev audit loops

Each loop samples 20 anaphora-bearing cards from `classic.json`, excluding every
card already present in `coref_standard.json`, `coref_dataset.json`, or a
previous audit. Cards are parsed sentence-by-sentence and then run through the
deterministic coreference resolver. A loop is clean only when every sentence
parses and the inspected anaphora choices are semantically defensible.

## Loop 1 — seed 20261023

Cards:

`Immortal Phoenix`, `Isareth the Awakener`, `Garruk, Apex Predator`,
`Void Stalker`, `Omnath, Locus of the Roil`, `Hungering Hydra`, `Phantom Beast`,
`Anticipate`, `Rienne, Angel of Rebirth`, `Cavalier of Thorns`,
`Reduce to Ashes`, `Garruk, Unleashed`, `Marauding Raptor`, `Nissa, Worldwaker`,
`Liliana's Spoils`, `Inferno Titan`, `Oppressive Rays`, `Basri's Lieutenant`,
`Retributive Wand`, `Ancestral Blade`.

### Parse failures found and fixed

| card | sentence / cause | fix |
|---|---|---|
| Isareth the Awakener | `return ... to the battlefield with a corpse counter on it` had no generic counter-return variant | added `V_RETURN ... "with" counter_amount counter_kind "on" "it"` |
| Rienne, Angel of Rebirth | `return it to its owner's hand at the beginning of the next end step` had timing only on battlefield returns | added the timing suffix to hand returns |
| Void Stalker | coordinated `Put this creature and target creature ...`; plural `their owners' libraries`; `those players shuffle their libraries` | added coordinated put-target variant, plural owner token, plural-player subject, and `shuffle their libraries` |
| Cavalier of Thorns | `Put a land card ... onto the battlefield and the rest into your graveyard` | added the mixed onto-battlefield/rest-into-zone put variant |
| Nissa, Worldwaker | `They're still lands` only had the singular `It's still a land` form | added plural `They're still ...` |
| Oppressive Rays | `can't attack or block unless ...` was misparsed as plain `attack or block` | allowed the `unless` clause on that alternative |
| Sublime Archangel | `Other creatures you control have exalted`; `exalted` was not a keyword | added `exalted` to `KEYWORD`; existing `have kw_list` rule then parses it |

### Coreference/output fixes found and fixed

- **Oppressive Rays**: `its controller` had no `Enchanted creature` candidate.
  Status-headed NPs were missing from the regex inventory; added
  `enchanted/equipped/attacking/...` to the determiner prefixes.
- **Ancestral Blade**: `attach this Equipment to it` bound `it` to the Equipment.
  For an attachment destination (`... to it`), the pronoun is the recipient, not
  the Equipment; added an `attachment-destination` rule ahead of the existing
  attachment-object rule.
- **Garruk, Apex Predator**: `You gain life equal to its toughness` bound `its`
  to `You`. Added a narrow `life-equal-object` rule that excludes players/`You`.
- **Marauding Raptor**: `this creature deals 2 damage to it` was ambiguous with
  `this creature`; the damage object cannot be the subject. Added
  `damage-object-not-self`.
- **Return/put output**: `return` no longer includes the verb in its `to` string
  and records a counter; put actions keep both coordinated targets and distinguish
  `zone` from `rest_zone`.

### Remaining limitation

`Void Stalker`: `those players` should be the owners of the two permanents, and
`their owners' libraries` is a collection/player relationship. The inventory has
no owner-player mention, so `those players` still binds to `target creature`.
This is a known collection/owner inventory gap, not a parse failure.

### Verification

- 20/20 sampled cards now parse every non-modal sentence.
- `test_output.py FDN.json`: 44/44.
- Dev coreference: **90.4% entity-aware / 84.4% exact** (was 90.1 / 84.1).
- Bench coreference: **94.1% regex / 93.0% parser** (unchanged).
